![Data Science Template](https://github.com/debarshee2004/data_science_template/assets/129538241/830a7f1d-34f3-4f35-82d4-4142158d33c9)

Welcome to the Data Science Project Template repository! This template is designed to provide you with a structured foundation for your data science projects, helping you maintain consistency, organization, and best practices throughout your project lifecycle.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this template will assist you in setting up your projects quickly and efficiently. It includes a well-defined directory structure, placeholder files, and guidelines for each phase of a typical data science project.

## Features

- **Structured Directory Layout**: The repository offers a clean and organized directory structure to house different aspects of your data science project, including code, data, documentation, and more.

- **Placeholder Files**: Placeholder files with clear naming conventions are provided within the template. You can easily replace these with your actual project files as you progress.

- **Documentation Support**: The template encourages good documentation practices. You'll find markdown files where you can detail your project overview, data sources, methodology, results, and conclusions.

- **Environment Management**: Utilize a virtual environment to manage dependencies and package versions effectively. The template provides a basic setup to get you started.

- **Version Control**: The repository comes ready with a `.gitignore` file to exclude commonly unnecessary files from version control. This helps maintain a clean and focused repository.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository into your local workspace using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/debarshee2004/data-science-template.git
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the project directory that was just cloned:

```sh
cd data-science-template
```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Use the package manager of your choice (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to create and activate the environment.

**To activate**

```sh
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**To deactivate**

```sh
deactivate
```

4. **Install Dependencies**: If using a virtual environment, install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Replace Placeholder Files**: Begin replacing the placeholder files with your actual project files. Follow the directory structure to maintain organization.

6. **Documentation**: Update the provided markdown files with your project details. This could include the project overview, data sources, data preprocessing steps, modeling approaches, results, and conclusions.

7. **Code**: Write your data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling code within the appropriate directories. Organize your codebase for clarity and maintainability.

8. **Data**: Place your dataset or data sources in the designated `data` directory. Ensure you update the data paths within your code accordingly.

9. **Version Control**: Initialize your project's Git repository and make your initial commit:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

10. **Start Working**: You're all set! Begin your data science project by iterating through the data analysis, modeling, and evaluation phases.
